# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based sorting visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This tool helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually representing the sorting process.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Bubble Sort 
[Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Repeats the process until the array is sorted.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)

### 2. Selection Sort
[Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the beginning.
- Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)

### 3. Insertion Sort
[Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- Good for small or nearly sorted data.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)

### 4. Merge Sort
 [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts, and merges them.
- Very efficient and stable.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

### 5. Quick Sort
 [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
- Selects a pivot and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.
- Recursively sorts the partitions.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst

### 6. Heap Sort
[Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
- Converts the array into a heap structure and sorts it by repeatedly removing the largest element.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

## 🎮 Features
- Adjustable array size using a slider.
- Adjustable sorting speed using a speed slider.
- Visual animation of each sorting step.
- New array generation.
- Interactive buttons for each algorithm.
